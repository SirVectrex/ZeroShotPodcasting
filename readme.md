# ZeroShotPodcasting Monorepo

Welcome to **ZeroShotPodcasting**, a comprehensive toolkit for zero-shot podcast script generation, evaluation, and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis â€” all powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) and state-of-the-art TTS engines.

*Note:* The Google TTS API was introduced very shortly before paper submission - the Paper submission state of the repository was freezed as a release. The change after paper submission include: support of Google TTS API, Jupyter notebook for interactive podcast generation, and a few minor bug fixes.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Zero-shot Podcast Script Generation:** Generate engaging, natural podcast scripts from JSON-configured prompts without manual scripting.
- **Multi-speaker Dialogue TTS:** Produce high-quality audio using Dia 1.6B TTS with voice cloning and dialogue modes.
- **Automated Script Evaluation:** Evaluate podcast scripts for coherence, topic relevance, and audience appropriateness with GPT-powered judging.
- **Comprehensive Benchmarking:** Evaluate both LLMs and TTS systems for quality, readability, and audience fit.
- **Visualization & Analysis:** Plot and analyze LLM outputs and TTS performance metrics.
- **Modular & Extensible:** Easily swap or add new LLMs or TTS engines with a clean modular design.



## ðŸ“š Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install dependencies (see individual subfolder `readme.md` files for details)
- API keys and local servers:
  - OpenAI API key for LLM interactions (set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
  - Google TTS API key (set environment variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY`)
  - optionally Dia-TTS server running locally or remotely (default: `http://localhost:8003/tts`)
