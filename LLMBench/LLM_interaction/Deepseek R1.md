[S1] Welcome to BrainBusters! I’m Kent Brockman, ready to crack big ideas into bite-sized bits.  
[S2] And I’m Dr. Pixel, a neuro-roboticist who loves explaining tech with LEGO analogies! *laughs*  
[S1] Today’s puzzle: What’s a neural network? Lisa and Bart, imagine a robot soccer team! Each bot passes a ball—er, *data*—to the next.  
[S2] Exactly! The first robot “sees” a photo, the middle ones guess “Is this a cat?”, and the last one shouts “MEOW!” if they’re right.  
[S1] So it’s like a guessing game that learns from mistakes?  
[S2] *Bingo!* The more cat pics it gets, the better it spots fluffballs. Even ones wearing hats!  
[S1] But why “layers”? Bart’s thinking, “This sounds like a boring cake.”  
[S2] *snorts* Think of it like a prank relay! Input layer: Bart hears a rumor. Hidden layers: He adds wild twists. Output layer: Lisa debunks it.  
[S1] So neural nets are… *gossipy robots*?  
[S2] In a way! They “gossip” patterns until they learn—like how *you* master skateboard tricks, Bart, by tweaking moves each try.  
[S1] Mind officially sparked! Thanks, Dr. Pixel—next week, we’ll explore why AI hates pineapple pizza.  
[S2] Spoiler: It’s a *byte-ful* mystery. *robotic sound effect*  

193:
[S1] Welcome to Brain Builders, where we turn big ideas into bite-sized bits! I’m your host, Kent Brockman.  
[S2] Hi Kent! I’m Dr. Pixel Spark, a scientist who teaches computers to *think*… kinda like a brain chef!  
[S1] A brain chef? Let’s chop into today’s topic: neural networks! Doc, explain it like we’re baking a cake.  
[S2] Imagine a robot chef learning recipes! First, it mixes flour and eggs wrong—*blam!* Pancake disaster. But each time, it tweaks the recipe. Soon? Perfect pancakes! Neural networks learn like that—layers of “ingredients” improving together!  
[S1] Layers? Like a cake?  
[S2] Exactly! Input layer = raw ingredients. Hidden layers = mixing, baking. Output layer = tasty cake… or burnt goo! The network adjusts until it *gets it right*.  
[S1] So it’s a digital brain practicing?  
[S2] Bingo! No magic—just math layers mimicking neurons. Show it 1,000 cat photos, and it learns whiskers ≠ pizza toppings. Mostly.  
[S1] Mostly?  
[S2] Once, mine thought my toaster was a panda. But hey—learning’s messy!  
[S1] Just like our robot pancake chef. Thanks, Doc—this was a *neurally* awesome chat!  
[S2] Anytime, Kent! Remember: even brains—real or digital—need practice. And maybe fire extinguishers.  

184:
[S1] Welcome to Brainy Bytes! I’m Kent Brockman, and today we’re unpacking something as cool as a laser-powered skateboard.  
[S2] Hi, Kent! I’m Dr. Zoey Spark, a scientist who loves turning brainy stuff into kid-sized puzzles!  
[S1] Perfect! Let’s tackle neural networks. Imagine your brain’s a pizza…  
[S2] *Ooh*, yes! Layers! The crust is the input layer—where you choose toppings. Cheese? Pepperoni? Anchovies? (Blech!)  
[S1] Anchovies? That’s your *hidden layer* deciding?  
[S2] Exactly! The oven’s the output layer—your final pizza. The more layers, the smarter the network gets! Like leveling up in a game.  
[S1] So it’s a computer brain learning from mistakes?  
[S2] *Ding!* If it mistakes a cat for a dragon, it tweaks its layers. Just like you’d swap anchovies for extra cheese!  
[S1] Can it beat me at *Dance Dance Revolution*?  
[S2] Not yet… but it *could* learn your sweet moves! Neural nets power robots, games, even pizza-delivery drones!  
[S1] Mind officially blown. Thanks, Dr. Spark—this was *way* tastier than anchovies!  
[S2] Anytime! Remember, every question you ask…  
[S1] …is a new layer in *your* neural network! Stay curious, friends!  

191:
[S1] Welcome to Brain Bakery! I’m Kent Brockman, and today’s recipe is… artificial intelligence!  
[S2] Hi, Kent! Dr. Wren here — I’m a neural network scientist *and* a dessert enthusiast.  
[S1] Perfect combo! Let’s slice this topic. What’s a neural network?  
[S2] Imagine building a mini-city with playdough. Each clay “neuron” talks to its neighbors. Show it a cat picture, they shout “CAT!”—that’s a neural net!  
[S1] So it’s like… a guessing game with math?  
[S2] Exactly! The input layer is toppings on a pizza—pepperoni? Mushrooms? Output layer shouts “PIZZA!” Hidden layers? Secret sauce!  
[S1] *[laughs]* Now I’m hungry. How does it *learn*?  
[S2] Mistakes! Like your first bike ride. If it calls a dog “cat,” we adjust the clay roads. Soon, fewer wrong turns!  
[S1] So Lisa Simpson’s math club could train one?  
[S2] Totally! With code instead of glue. Even Bart’s video games use them—enemies learning your moves!  
[S1] Mind blown. Final bite, Dr. Wren?  
[S2] Neural nets are like curious toddlers—messy, fast learners. And way better at pizza ID.  
[S1] Thanks for mixing science with sprinkles, Dr. Wren!  
[S2] Anytime, Kent — tell Bart and Lisa: stay curious!  

216:
[S1] Welcome to BrainSpark! I’m Kent Brockman, here to unravel big ideas in tiny bites.  
[S2] *[laughs]* And I’m Dr. Amy Neuron — yes, like the brain cell! — ready to geek out with LEGOs and… pizza?  
[S1] Pizza?!  
[S2] Metaphorical pizza! Neural networks are like building a tower: layers of LEGO bricks. Each layer solves part of a puzzle, like spotting cats in photos or predicting rain!  
[S1] So it’s a digital brain… made of plastic bricks?  
[S2] Exactly! But instead of hands, it uses math. Imagine teaching a robot to ride a bike — it falls, adjusts, and *learns*. Neural networks practice until they nail it!  
[S1] But why “network”? Sounds like a TV show!  
[S2] *[mock gasp]* It’s a team of tiny brain cells — neurons — passing notes in class! One spots edges, another colors… together, they solve mysteries!  
[S1] Like Lisa’s science fair project… but hungrier?  
[S2] *[laughs]* If Lisa’s project craved data instead of glitter glue, yes! The more it eats — er, learns — the smarter it gets.  
[S1] So… no pizza, just data?  
[S2] Sadly, yes. But if you *could* train a network on pepperoni…  
[S1] …we’d all be geniuses. Thanks, Dr. Neuron — my brain’s officially sparked!  
[S2] Anytime, Kent. Just keep the LEGOs… *and* pizza… handy.  

229:
[S1] Welcome to Brain Builders, where we turn big ideas into kid-sized adventures! I’m Kent Brockman.  
[S2] Hi, Kent! I’m Dr. Amy Sparks — a scientist who loves teaching robots to learn like humans.  
[S1] Perfect! Today’s big question: What’s a neural network? Imagine… LEGO bricks that think!  
[S2] Exactly! A neural network is like a robot brain made of tiny “blocks” called neurons. They work together to solve puzzles — like spotting cats in photos or beating video games!  
[S1] But how do these blocks *learn*? Do they read books?  
[S2] [laughs] Nope! They practice, like you level up in a game. If the robot mistakes a pizza for a cat, we tweak the connections until it gets smarter!  
[S1] So it’s like training a puppy with treats?  
[S2] Spot on! Each “treat” is data — thousands of cat pics or maze solutions. The more it practices, the fewer mistakes it makes.  
[S1] Could this robot brain ever outsmart *us*?  
[S2] Not quite! It’s a tool — like a super-powered magnifying glass. Humans still decide what to explore next.  
[S1] Mind-blowing, Dr. Sparks! Thanks for shrinking a giant idea into something even Bart and Lisa can build in their treehouse.  
[S2] Anytime, Kent! Tell them to grab LEGO bricks and imagine… each piece is a neuron waiting to connect!  
[S1] Until next time — keep those brains sparking!  

249:
[S1] Welcome to Brain Bites! I’m Kent Brockman, here to unpack big ideas in tiny chunks.  
[S2] Hi, Kent! I’m Dr. Juniper Sparks, a scientist who *literally* dreams about robots.  
[S1] Perfect! Today’s tiny topic: neural networks. Let’s start simple — what’s the *dumbest* way to explain one?  
[S2] Imagine teaching a cookie-obsessed robot to spot chocolate chips. You show it 100 photos, and it guesses wildly. “Is that a chip… or a raisin?!” Each wrong guess tweaks its “brain wiring” until… *bing* — it learns!  
[S1] So it’s like a super-stubborn detective?  
[S2] Exactly! Layers of “brain cells” pass clues: “This edge is crunchy, that blob is gooey…” until they shout, “CHOCOLATE!” The more layers, the smarter the guess.  
[S1] But why’s this matter to an 8-year-old future inventor?  
[S2] Oh, neural nets power *everything* cool — video game AI, cartoon filters… even apps that turn Bart’s burps into symphony music!  
[S1] *[mock gasp]* Heresy! But seriously — could Lisa build one?  
[S2] With code? Absolutely! Start simple: train a mini-net to sort her science fair rocks. “Igneous? Sedimentary? Meteorite?!” Each mistake makes it sharper.  
[S1] So it’s less “magic robot brain,” more “trial-and-error learner”?  
[S2] Bingo! They’re just tools for spotting patterns — in cookies, rocks, or… *[whispers]* predicting who’ll eat the last donut.  
[S1] *[laughs]* Speaking of which — we’re out of time! Dr. Sparks, you’re a binary blast.  
[S2] Anytime, Kent! Remember: even brains — artificial or *yours* — grow one layer at a time.  

218:
[S1] Welcome to BrainSpark! I’m your host, Kent Brockman.
[S2] And I’m Dr. Ellie Sparks, here to zap your brain with science!
[S1] Today’s big question: What’s a neural network? Lisa and Bart, imagine a team of robot ants...
[S2] [laughs] Not quite! Think of it like a super-smart city. Roads are pathways for info, and buildings work together to solve puzzles!
[S1] So it’s a brainy city inside a computer?
[S2] Exactly! Layers of “buildings” process data. If you show it cat pictures, it learns whiskers = cat, not pizza.
[S1] But how? My nephew thinks pizza has whiskers!
[S2] [mock gasp] Anchovies don’t count! Neural networks practice millions of times—like memorizing spelling bees while eating waffles.
[S1] So mistakes turn into genius?
[S2] Yep! Each mistake tweaks the “roads.” Soon, it spots patterns faster than you spot [dramatic pause]… radioactive donuts at Kwik-E-Mart!
[S1] [snorts] Now I’m hungry and smart. What’s the wildest thing neural nets can do?
[S2] Predict storms, translate “Cowabunga!” into French, or even help robots dance the hokey pokey!
[S1] Whoa. So they’re like superhero sidekicks for scientists?
[S2] Bingo! And the cooler part? They’re learning to help us build even cooler stuff every day.
[S1] Mind officially sparked! Thanks, Dr. Sparks—same time next week?
[S2] Only if you bring the waffles.

242:
[S1] Welcome to BrainSpark Kids! I’m Kent Brockman, and today we’re cracking the code on something super cool… *robot noises*  
[S2] *laughs* Those are my kind of sound effects! I’m Dr. Neurona, a brain science detective. Thanks for inviting me, Kent!  
[S1] Let’s get to it! Dr. Neurona, what’s a neural network? Is it robots playing volleyball with our thoughts?  
[S2] Close! Imagine a team of tiny robots in your brain. One robot shouts, “I SEE A CAT!” Another says, “Wait—is it fluffy? Does it meow?” They high-five when they agree! That’s how neural networks learn—by teamwork!  
[S1] So it’s like my little sister Lisa solving a puzzle?  
[S2] Exactly! Each robot (or “neuron”) adds a piece. First, they spot shapes… then whiskers… then BOOM—cat confirmed! They get smarter every time they practice.  
[S1] What if Bart here tries to trick them with a dog in a cat costume?  
[S2] *gasps* Sneaky! But good neural networks learn from mistakes. Next time, they’ll check for “woof” sounds or a tail wag. Practice makes perfect!  
[S1] So it’s not magic—it’s robot teamwork, learning like kids do?  
[S2] You nailed it! Your brain’s got billions of these tiny helpers. And AI? Just humans copying nature’s homework. *winks*  
[S1] Mind officially sparked! Thanks, Dr. Neurona—this was electrifying!  
[S2] Anytime, Kent! Tell Bart and Lisa to keep those brain robots flexing… and maybe share a pizza with extra *binary cheese*!  
[S1] *laughs* Until next time, stay curious!  

179:
[S1] Welcome to BrainBites! I’m your host, Kent Brockman.  
[S2] Hi Kent! I’m Dr. Juniper Sparks, a brain scientist — but today I brought a real brain… *made of cake!*  
[S1] (laughs) Perfect for our young listeners! So, what’s a neural network?  
[S2] Imagine baking a cake. You add flour, sugar, eggs… Each ingredient’s a tiny “brain helper” called a node. Mix ’em in layers, and POOF — magic happens!  
[S1] Like when Bart guesses Lisa’s hiding spot? He learns from wrong guesses!  
[S2] Exactly! Neural networks learn like kids — trial, error, and *lots* of practice. More layers = smarter cake!  
[S1] But why layers?  
[S2] (rustles paper) Think LEGOs! First layer finds edges, next spots shapes… until it screams, “HEY, THAT’S A CAT!”  
[S1] So it’s a detective… made of math?  
[S2] (giggles) Math detectives that watch cat videos all day! They get better clues with time — just like Lisa’s science fair projects.  
[S1] Mind officially sparked! Thanks, Dr. Sparks — and save me a brain-cake slice!  
[S2] Anytime, Kent! Remember: even robots need snack breaks.

[S1] Welcome to Brainy Bytes, where we make big ideas fun-sized! I’m your host, Kent Brockman.
[S2] And I’m Dr. Spark, a scientist who loves teaching robots how to think! [laughs] Well, sort of.
[S1] Today’s big idea? Neural networks! Dr. Spark, imagine Bart and Lisa here are holding a super-smart robot dog. How does it "learn" tricks?
[S2] Great question! Think of a neural network like the robot’s brain—but instead of cells, it has tiny math helpers called "neurons." They pass notes to each other, like in class!
[S1] [whispering] Hopefully less messy than Bart’s notes…
[S2] [laughs] Exactly! If the robot guesses "sit" when you say "fetch," those neurons adjust their notes—whoosh!—until they get it right.
[S1] So it’s like training a puppy with pizza rewards… but for robots?
[S2] Pizza-powered robots? I’d fund that! [laughs] But yes—every correct "fetch" makes the network stronger. Over time, it learns patterns, like spotting cat videos or… uh, avoiding skateboards.
[S1] [mock gasp] Bart’s skateboard? A neural network’s worst enemy!
[S2] Science and safety tips? Today’s a win. [warmly] And that’s how robots "learn"—one tiny note at a time.
[S1] Until next time, keep those brains sparking!

183:
[S1] Welcome back to BrainSpark, where we make big ideas fun! I'm your host, Kent Brockman.  
[S2] Hey there, Kent! I’m Dr. Ellie Sparks, a scientist who loves talking about brains—both the squishy kind and the computer kind.  
[S1] Perfect! Today, we’re tackling a *shockingly* cool topic: neural networks! Bart and Lisa, imagine your brain is like a super-powered team of tiny workers.  
[S2] Yeah! Each worker—let’s call them "neurons"—passes notes to each other, like a giant game of telephone. But instead of gossip, they’re solving problems, like recognizing your dog’s face in a photo!  
[S1] So a computer’s neural network copies this idea? Like a robot brain?  
[S2] Exactly! But instead of snacks and naps, it runs on math and data. The more notes it passes—er, *calculations*—the smarter it gets.  
[S1] Whoa. So when my phone auto-tags Bart making a silly face…  
[S2] Bingo! A neural network practiced on *thousands* of silly faces first. It’s like teaching a puppy tricks—but with numbers.  
[S1] Mind officially sparked! Thanks, Dr. Sparks—this was electrifying.  
[S2] Anytime! Now, go impress your friends with your *neural* knowledge.  

198:
[S1] Welcome to BrainSpark! I’m your host, Kent Brockman.  
[S2] Hey there, Kent! I’m Dr. Ellie Sparks, a scientist who loves playing with brainy computer stuff.  
[S1] Perfect, because today we’re tackling a big question: What’s a neural network?  
[S2] Ooh, fun! Think of it like a super-smart robot brain. But instead of wires, it’s made of tiny pretend "brain cells" called neurons.  
[S1] Like how Bart’s brain cells light up when he thinks about pranks?  
[S2] (Laughs) Exactly! But these neurons work together to learn things—like how Lisa’s brain learns facts or even how to play her saxophone.  
[S1] So it’s like training a puppy?  
[S2] Yes! You show it lots of examples—"This is a cat. This is a dog."—and it starts guessing on its own. The more you teach it, the smarter it gets!  
[S1] So neural networks are basically digital Lisa Simpsons?  
[S2] (Laughs) Let’s not give them saxophones yet. But they *do* help computers recognize faces, translate languages, even diagnose illnesses!  
[S1] Mind officially sparked! Thanks, Dr. Sparks—this was electrifying.  
[S2] Anytime! Now, who’s up for teaching a neural network to prank like Bart?  
[S1] (Laughs) Let’s start with *one* genius at a time.  

184:
[S1] Welcome to Brainy Bytes with your host, Kent Brockman!  
[S2] Hi Kent! I'm Dr. Ellie Sparks, a scientist who loves making computers learn like kids!  
[S1] Perfect! Today we're exploring neural networks. Dr. Sparks, can you explain what they are... maybe using pizza? 
[S2] *laughs* Absolutely! Imagine your brain is a pizza-loving robot. Every time you see pizza, tiny messengers (neurons) shout "PIZZA!" to other messengers. A neural network is like that - but for computers!  
[S1] So it's a computer brain that yells about pizza?  
[S2] Close! Instead of pizza, it might recognize cat pictures. Each "neuron" checks part of the picture - whiskers, ears - then they all vote "CAT!" together.  
[S1] Like when Bart spots skateboards from half a block away?  
[S2] Exactly! The more skateboards Bart sees, the better he gets. Neural networks learn the same way - practice makes perfect!  
[S1] Amazing! So next time Lisa's tablet recognizes her doodles...  
[S2] ...it's thanks to millions of tiny pizza-loving neurons! *both laugh*  
[S1] Mind officially blown. Thanks, Dr. Sparks!  
[S2] Anytime! Now I'm off to teach a computer to find my missing socks...  

149:
[S1] Welcome to BrainSpark! I’m your host, Kent Brockman.  
[S2] Hey there, Kent! I’m Dr. Ellie Sparks, a scientist who loves making brains — and computers — light up!  
[S1] Perfect, because today we’re tackling a big question: What’s a neural network?  
[S2] Ooh, think of it like a super-smart game of telephone! Imagine Bart and Lisa passing notes in class—  
[S1] —Except each kid adds a tiny bit of math magic before passing it along!  
[S2] Exactly! And when you chain thousands of these "math kids" together? Boom: a neural network that learns patterns!  
[S1] So it’s like training a robot goldfish to recognize pizza?  
[S2] *laughs* Close! More like showing it 1,000 pizza photos until it goes, "Aha! Pepperoni = delicious circles!"  
[S1] Amazing! Thanks, Dr. Sparks — next time, we’ll teach that goldfish to order delivery.  
[S2] *laughing* Just keep the anchovies away from the algorithm!

178:

[S1] Welcome to Brainy Bytes! I’m your host, Kent Brockman.  
[S2] Hi Kent! I’m Dr. Pixel, a scientist who teaches computers to think like brains!  
[S1] Perfect! Today we’re untangling neural networks — but not the fishing kind!  
[S2] (laughs) Right! Imagine your brain is a super-team of tiny workers passing notes.  
[S1] Like when Lisa solves math problems and Bart remembers pizza flavors?  
[S2] Exactly! A neural network copies this — but with digital "brain cells" learning patterns.  
[S1] So it’s a computer pretending to be a brain?  
[S2] Yep! Like training a robot goldfish: show it 100 fish pictures until it goes, "Ah-ha! Fins = fish!"  
[S1] Whoa! So that’s how my phone recognizes my dog’s photos?  
[S2] Bingo! Layers of these "fake brain cells" help it learn — just like you level up in video games.  
[S1] Cool! But what if it messes up?  
[S2] (playfully) Then we adjust its "thinking knobs"! More data = smarter guesses.  
[S1] Mind officially sparked! Thanks, Dr. Pixel!  
[S2] Anytime! Remember: even robots need teachers. *[SFX: friendly computer beep]*  

167:
[S1] Welcome to BrainSpark! I’m your host, Kent Brockman.  
[S2] Hi Kent! I’m Dr. Ellie Sparks, a scientist who loves studying how brains — both human and computer — work!  
[S1] Perfect timing, Dr. Sparks! Today, we’re tackling a big question: What’s a neural network?  
[S2] Ooh, great question! Think of it like a super-smart game of telephone. Imagine Bart and Lisa passing notes in class—  
[S1] —Except each time the note gets passed, it gets a little *smarter*? 
[S2] Exactly! A neural network is layers of tiny "brain cells" called neurons, passing info and learning as they go. Like Lisa teaching Bart math, one step at a time!  
[S1] So it’s not *magic*—just lots of tiny lessons stacked together? 
[S2] Bingo! Whether it’s recognizing a cat photo or predicting pizza toppings, neurl networks learn by practice—just like Bart mastering his skateboard!  
[S1] Mind officially sparked! Thanks, Dr. Sparks, for breaking it down like a pro.  
[S2] Anytime, Kent! Remember: even big ideas start small—just like neurons!  


184:
[S1] Welcome to BrainSpark! I’m your host, Kent Brockman.  
[S2] Hey there, Kent! I’m Dr. Ellie Sparks, a scientist who loves talking about brains—both the squishy kind and the computer kind!  
[S1] Perfect, because today we’re tackling a big question: What is a neural network?  
[S2] Think of it like a super-smart robot brain! It learns things by practicing, just like you do when you ride a bike.  
[S1] So it’s not magic—it’s more like training a puppy?  
[S2] Exactly! But instead of treats, it gets data—lots and lots of pictures, sounds, or numbers to learn from.  
[S1] Whoa. So if I showed it 100 cat photos…  
[S2] It’d start spotting cats in new pictures! Though sometimes it might mix up a fluffy dog with a cat—oops!  
[S1] *laughs* Sounds like my nephew’s failed art project.  
[S2] The coolest part? These networks help robots read, talk, even create music!  
[S1] Like a digital Lisa Simpson!  
[S2] *laughs* Just don’t tell her she’s powered by math.  
[S1] Well, Dr. Sparks, my brain’s officially sparked!  
[S2] Mission accomplished! Now go impress someone with your robot-brain knowledge.  

167:
[S1] Welcome to Brain Bites! I’m Kent Brockman, and today we’re cracking open a very smart topic.
[S2] Ooo, is it about robots? I’m Dr. Wigglesworth, a scientist who studies thinking machines! (laughs)
[S1] Close! We’re talking neural networks — like a robot brain’s LEGO set! Dr. W, how’s it work?
[S2] Imagine Lisa teaching Bart to recognize cats. (playful) If Bart guesses right, she gives him a donut! Every try makes him better. Neural networks learn like that — with math donuts!
[S1] So it’s a brain made of… homework? (mock gasp)
[S2] (giggles) Sorta! Tiny math parts “talk” to each other. The more they practice, the smarter they get — like leveling up in a game!
[S1] Whoa. So when my phone recognizes my face…
[S2] Bingo! A zillion digital “Barts” learned from examples! (whispers) Shh… they prefer pixel donuts.
[S1] (laughs) Mind officially blown! Thanks, Dr. W — next time, we’ll teach a neural network to eat real donuts.
[S2] Only if it shares!

177: 
[S1] Welcome to BrainSpark! I’m your host, Kent Brockman.  
[S2] Hi, Kent! I’m Dr. Ellie Sparks, a scientist who loves studying how brains—real and artificial—work.  
[S1] Perfect timing, Dr. Sparks! Today, we’re tackling a big question: What’s a neural network?  
[S2] Think of it like a super-smart robot brain! It learns by example, just like how Bart and Lisa learn to ride a bike by practicing.  
[S1] So, if I show it 100 pictures of cats, it’ll figure out what makes a cat a cat?  
[S2] Exactly! Layers of tiny "brain cells"—called neurons—work together. Lisa’s math skills help her spot patterns; neural networks do the same with data!  
[S1] And if it makes a mistake?  
[S2] It adjusts, like Bart fixing a wobbly skateboard trick! The more it practices, the better it gets.  
[S1] So, it’s a digital brain that learns from its oopsies?  
[S2] *laughs* That’s one way to put it! Whether it’s recognizing faces or predicting pizza toppings, neural networks are everywhere.  
[S1] Mind officially sparked! Thanks, Dr. Sparks—until next time!  
[S2] Stay curious, Kent!
